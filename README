Build requirements
==================

Required Packages in order to build

	libboost-dev
	cmake
	<one C++11 compatible compiler: g++, clang, MSVC, etc>

this sample was tested using CLang 3.2 under Linux Mint 15 (Olivia).
To generate build scripts you can use your favorite CMake options, here we explain a basic example.
You can use cmake-gui in order to get graphical user interface to configure the build system.

	$ mkdir fast-hopcroft-build
	$ cd fast-hopcroft-build
	$ cmake ../fast-hopcroft -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

You should get a few lines similar the following output.

	-- The C compiler identification is GNU 4.7.2
	-- The CXX compiler identification is Clang 3.0.0
	-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc
	-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc -- works
	-- Detecting C compiler ABI info
	-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done
	-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++
	-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ -- works
	-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info
	-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
	-- Boost version: 1.49.0
	-- Configuring done
	-- Generating done
	-- Build files have been written to: /home/user/Documents/fast-hopcroft/build

Now you can build the Release binary configuration

	$ make

Finally, you can execute the binary.

	$ ./FastHopcroftExecutable
